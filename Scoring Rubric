Flowers
  Decayed fruits will always be pointed up, flowers are drooping down and white-ish.
  Fruits are not considered flowers (would score N)
  If living flowers present - stem will be covered in flowers, not completely sparse
  Dead flowers (from previous year) - who cares? score N
  If you can't tell definitively yes or no due to quality of photo, don't guess. Put A
  If stalk is mostly empty and pods are dark and pointing upwards, most likely a N. But use judgement about A. 
  
Senesced
    Be careful about species - some buds are dark and look like senesced flowers
    If flowers are dead, considered no flowers not senesced
    
Whole plant
    If you can see all the parts, lean towards whole plant (ie if the tips of the leaves are not visible)
    In cases of flowers present - you need to consider that plant to be whole or not
    In cases of flowers absent - if you can see at least one whole plant, consider whole
    Close up of a multi-branched yucca - part of a plant
    In cases where you can't tell if there are one or multiple plant, put partial.
