Flowers
  Decayed fruits will always be pointed up, flowers are typically drooping down and creamy to white in color
  Fruits are "pointing up", darker in color and usually more sparse on the stalk.  
  If living flowers present - stem will be covered in flowers, not sparse
  We decided to change scoring to ask "Are there non-senesced flowers visible on the plant (Y/N)"
  If you can't tell definitively yes or no due to quality of photo or distance of plant from photographer
  (some are blurry or too far away), don't guess. Put A (for ambiguous)
  Be careful about species - some buds are dark and look like senesced flowers
  If there is ONE non-senesced flower visible on the plant, score this as YES.
  
Whole plant
    In cases where all most of all the parts of the plant are visible, lean towards whole plant
    An example is where all leaves are partially visible, score as "whole plant"
    It is more critical to carefully score whole plants where flowers are absent but try to score all correctly
    In some corner cases, the very top of a flower stalk may not be photographed. 
    We discussed this corner case, and we decided if the stalk is clearly dead, then it is ok to score 
    whole plant even if there is a small missing top part of the stalk.
    In cases of flowers absent - if you can see at least one whole plant in the photograph, consider it a whole plant
    In cases where there is a close up of a multi-branched yucca - that is definitely "part of a plant". 
    If you cannot tell if the plant is "multibranched" or a single plant, score this as ambiguous rather than a wild guess.
